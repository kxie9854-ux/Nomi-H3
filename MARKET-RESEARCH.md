# Video Editing Engine Market Review

Date: 2026-08-28
Scope: open-source editing cores, media backends, timeline interchange, and AI-agent integration relevant to Nomi (Electron + React + TypeScript).

## Executive decision

There is no single open-source project that can be dropped into Nomi and provide a CapCut-class editor without replacing the application model. The market splits the problem into layers:

```text
timeline semantics / undo / proposals       (application-owned)
media decode, encode, mux, probe              (FFmpeg, MediaBunny, WebCodecs)
composition and effects                      (WebGL/WASM, MLT, GES, libopenshot)
interchange                                  (OpenTimelineIO)
agent control                                (application-owned EditPlan/MCP)
```

The recommended build-vs-buy decision is:

1. Keep Nomi `TimelineState`/`EditPlan` as the only project truth and keep all edits atomic and undoable.
2. Reuse **MediaBunny** (MPL-2.0) for TypeScript media inspection, browser/Electron decode, trim/transcode and muxing where it passes our format tests.
3. Keep **FFmpeg** (LGPL build, with GPL components disabled unless deliberately accepted) as the production worker for broad codec/filter coverage, probing and final export. Nomi already packages FFmpeg/FFprobe installers.
4. Add an OTIO (Apache-2.0) import/export adapter at the boundary. OTIO is a schema and algorithm library, not a renderer.
5. Run a small compositor POC with WebAV or OpenCut WASM for responsive preview. Do not import OpenCut's store, UI, or command graph.
6. Evaluate MLT and libopenshot only behind a JSON worker protocol after P0/P1. They are the only candidates here that resemble a native NLE engine, but both have substantial native packaging and data-model mapping costs.
7. Do not embed Olive (GPL-3.0/alpha), OpenChatCut (AGPL-3.0), or OpenCut classic (archived) code in a proprietary/current Nomi path. Their architecture and agent workflow remain useful references.
8. Treat Palmier Pro (GPL-3.0/macOS Swift) as a tool-catalog and review-workflow reference only; do not couple Nomi to its native runtime or project format.

This gives a fast capability increase without introducing a second timeline truth source or coupling the Pi Agent/MCPSQ branches to a native editor runtime.

## Method and current status

Repository metadata, source trees, headers and package manifests were inspected through GitHub CLI (`gh api`/`gh search repos`) on 2026-08-28. The source links below point to the files that were checked. GitHub timestamps are current repository metadata, not a promise of release stability.

## At-a-glance matrix

| Project | License observed | What it actually provides | Electron + TypeScript integration | Fit for Nomi |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [MLT](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt) | LGPL-2.1 (core); some modules/dependencies vary | Native service graph: producers, playlists, multitrack, tractor, filters, transitions, consumers | Native C/C++ worker or Node-API wrapper; ship per-OS plugins and dependencies | Strong native NLE candidate, high integration cost |
| [GStreamer + GES](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer) | Core/GES headers use LGPL/LGPL-2.1; plugins vary | Streaming/media graph; GES adds timeline, layers, tracks, clips and editing commits | Native worker is realistic; direct N-API is expensive; Meson/Cerbero packaging | Good for live/streaming and custom pipelines, not the fastest NLE path |
| [libopenshot](https://github.com/OpenShot/libopenshot) | LGPL-3.0-or-later | C++ Timeline/Clip/Reader/Writer, compositing, effects, curves, retime, audio mixing | Native worker or C++ bridge; CMake + FFmpeg/OpenCV/Qt dependencies | Most feature-rich native library candidate; high packaging and API risk |
| [FFmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) | LGPL-2.1+ by default; optional GPL parts | Codec/container/filter/probe libraries and CLI; no timeline/undo model | Existing child-process worker is low cost; use safe argv and progress parsing | Production render/probe foundation, not an editor model |
| [OpenTimelineIO](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenTimelineIO) | Apache-2.0 | Timeline/track/clip/time/effect/transition schema, algorithms and adapters | C++/Python process or library; JSON `.otio` boundary is simple | Excellent interchange and validation boundary |
| [Remotion](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion) | Custom free/company license; company license may be required | React composition, Player and Node renderer using headless Chromium + FFmpeg | Excellent TS/Electron fit; no mutable NLE timeline/undo | Preview/export layer, not core editor state |
| [Olive](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive) | GPL-3.0 | Full Qt/C++ editor with node graph, sequence, render manager and undo commands | Embedding means embedding the application and GPL obligations | Reference only; README calls it alpha/unstable |
| [WebAV](https://github.com/WebAV-Tech/WebAV) | MIT | WebCodecs clips/sprites/canvas, audio mixing and MP4 output | Very low cost in Electron/browser; TS packages | Useful preview/fast path; incomplete as a professional NLE core |
| [Mediabunny](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny) | MPL-2.0 | Pure TS demux/mux, WebCodecs encode/decode, conversion, trim, resample | Very low; native/browser/Node support, tree-shakable | Best media-I/O component to validate first; no timeline model |
| [OpenCut main](https://github.com/OpenCut-app/OpenCut) | MIT | Rewrite in Rust/WASM with planned Editor API, plugins, MCP, headless mode | Not ready as a stable embed; Rust/WASM boundary still moving | Roadmap/reference; do not depend on main yet |
| [OpenCut classic](https://github.com/OpenCut-app/opencut-classic) | MIT, archived | Rich TS timeline manager and command/update pipeline | Code can be read, but repository is archived and app-coupled | Capability and algorithm reference only |
| [OpenChatCut](https://github.com/0xsline/OpenChatCut) | AGPL-3.0-or-later | Immutable EditorCore, Remotion/WebGL/FFmpeg, proposal-based MCP/Agent edits | Similar product shape, but AGPL and tightly coupled runtime | Agent protocol reference; do not copy code into Nomi |
| [FireRed-OpenStoryline](https://github.com/FireRedTeam/FireRed-OpenStoryline) | Apache-2.0 | Python/FastAPI MCP workflow made of registered nodes: media search/load, shot split/understanding, script/voice/BGM, beat-aware planning, ASR rough cut, AI transitions, render, and reusable Skills | Separate Python service and artifact/session store; integrate only through a manifest/worker boundary | Strong semantic-agent and workflow reference; not a timeline kernel |
| [Palmier Pro](https://github.com/palmier-io/palmier-pro) | GPL-3.0 | macOS Swift editor with a broad MCP surface: timeline/project/marker/settings/export, media import/inspection, track/clip CRUD, split/ripple, properties/keyframes/layout/sync, captions/transcript, audio/BGM/beat, effects/color/denoise and generation | Native Swift runtime and macOS-only app; GPL obligations and project schema are not a portable SDK | Best reference for domain-sliced tool coverage, inspect/render review and job management; do not embed |

| [video-use](https://github.com/browser-use/video-use) | MIT | Skill/workflow around FFmpeg and transcript-guided cuts with word-boundary padding, subtitle ordering, segment extraction/concat and bounded self-checks | Low-cost rules can be implemented in TypeScript; not a multi-track engine | Convert hard rules into Nomi validators and verify-render tests |
| [LosslessCut](https://github.com/mifi/lossless-cut) | GPL-2.0-only | Electron + FFmpeg lossless segment cutting and packaging | Useful packaging/worker patterns | Reference for lossless operations, not compositing |

## Detailed findings

### MLT: closest mature native NLE substrate

MLT's README describes it as an LGPL multimedia framework designed for video editing. The public C API is an object/service graph:

- `mlt_producer` generates audio/video/metadata and exposes speed, in/out points, cuts and attached filters ([header](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/framework/mlt_producer.h)).
- `mlt_playlist` is a sequential producer with append/insert/remove/move/reorder/resize/split/mix and blank management ([header](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/framework/mlt_playlist.h)).
- `mlt_multitrack` runs producers in parallel; `mlt_tractor` manages multitrack plus a `mlt_field`; `mlt_field` plants filters and transitions ([multitrack](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/framework/mlt_multitrack.h), [tractor](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/framework/mlt_tractor.h), [field](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/framework/mlt_field.h)).
- Transitions are first-class services between A/B tracks ([header](https://github.com/mltframework/mlt/blob/master/src/framework/mlt_transition.h)). MLT also has an XML parser and the `melt` CLI.

**Strengths:** proven multi-track primitives, filters/transitions, hardware/plugin ecosystem, and LGPL core. Shotcut uses the same MLT stack; this is evidence that MLT can support a desktop NLE.

**Costs:** C object lifetime/threading, plugin discovery, FFmpeg/SDL/OpenGL/audio dependencies, profiles and XML semantics, and per-OS native packaging. MLT's playlist index/time model is not Nomi's stable clip-ID/source-window model. A direct store bridge would create a second truth source and make Agent proposals hard to validate.

**Nomi recommendation:** evaluate as a sidecar worker. Serialize a validated Nomi render plan to a small MLT XML/JSON adapter, run `melt` or a dedicated worker, collect progress/errors and compare output against the FFmpeg backend. Do not expose MLT objects to the renderer or Agent.

### GStreamer + GStreamer Editing Services (GES)

The current `GStreamer/gstreamer` repository contains official modules under `subprojects`; the old `GStreamer/gst-editing-services` repository states that GES was merged into the main repository. The core README uses Meson/Ninja and notes that plugin licenses/dependencies vary (some optional plugins are GPL).

GES adds an editing abstraction over the GStreamer graph:

- `GESTimeline` owns layers/tracks and supports load/save URI, add/remove layers/tracks, commit (including synchronous commit), snapping, frame/time conversion and paste/move-layer ([header](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer/blob/main/subprojects/gst-editing-services/ges/ges-timeline.h)).
- `GESLayer` owns ordered clips and supports add/remove, interval queries, duration and auto-transition ([header](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer/blob/main/subprojects/gst-editing-services/ges/ges-layer.h)).
- `GESClip` supports track elements, effects and split; timeline/source time conversion is explicit ([header](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer/blob/main/subprojects/gst-editing-services/ges/ges-clip.h)).

**Strengths:** mature streaming, hardware/device integration, explicit nanosecond timestamps, and an actual editing layer (GES) instead of only a filter graph.

**Costs:** GLib/GObject ownership and signals, broad plugin matrix, Meson/Cerbero cross-platform packaging, and pipeline state/error handling. GES is attractive for capture/live/streaming products, but a Nomi adapter would still have to define IDs, undo, stale revision checks and Agent-safe transactions.

**Nomi recommendation:** reserve for a live-capture or streaming backend. Do not choose it as the first replacement for Nomi's local NLE export path.

### libopenshot: broad native editing API, but heavy integration

The README advertises cross-platform C++ APIs (C++, Python and Ruby), multi-layer compositing, effects, Bézier animation curves, curve-based time mapping, audio mixing/resampling, VST/AU plug-ins, FFmpeg formats/codecs, hardware acceleration and a Qt player. The source tree contains `Timeline`, `Clip`, `ReaderBase`, `WriterBase`, `FFmpegReader`, `FFmpegWriter`, `FrameMapper`, `AnimatedCurve`, effect and audio classes ([source tree](https://github.com/OpenShot/libopenshot/tree/develop/src)).

**Strengths:** closest to a library-shaped NLE core in this survey; many capabilities already exist below the UI, including retime, compositing, effects and audio.

**Costs:** CMake/native ABI, FFmpeg/OpenCV/ImageMagick/OpenMP and optional Qt/audio dependencies; object lifetime and thread model; project formats and APIs are OpenShot-shaped rather than Nomi-shaped. The README also advertises commercial licenses, so license/compliance should be checked with counsel before shipping a proprietary product.

**Nomi recommendation:** candidate for a time-boxed native worker POC after Nomi's render-plan contract is stable. Use a process protocol (JSON request + output artifact + diagnostics), not direct bindings in React/Electron. Only adopt if it demonstrates measurable wins for effects/audio/render parity without forcing its Timeline model into Nomi.

### FFmpeg: indispensable media backend, not a timeline engine

FFmpeg's README lists `libavcodec`, `libavformat`, `libavfilter`, `libavdevice`, `libswresample`, `libswscale` and the `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe` tools ([README](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/README.md)). The license file says the default codebase is LGPL-2.1-or-later; enabling GPL parts changes the resulting build to GPL, and `--enable-nonfree` may make a binary unredistributable ([license](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/blob/master/LICENSE.md)).

**Strengths:** format/codec coverage, deterministic filter graphs, hardware encoders, probe metadata, mature CLI and worker isolation. It is already present in Nomi's installer configuration and desktop bridge.

**Limits:** no stable clip IDs, timeline semantics, project model, proposal/undo, or visual preview. Filter graphs become difficult to maintain when they are generated directly from unvalidated Agent output.

**Nomi recommendation:** retain as the production renderer/prober behind a typed `RenderPlan` generated from validated `TimelineState`. Pin/configure a known LGPL build; document any GPL/nonfree codec choices. Never pass untrusted shell strings; use argv arrays and explicit temp directories.

### OpenTimelineIO (OTIO): interoperability, not rendering

OTIO is an Academy Software Foundation project under Apache-2.0. Its C++ API models a `Timeline` containing a `Stack` of `Track`s; tracks contain `Clip`s with `MediaReference`, source ranges, effects, markers and metadata ([timeline](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenTimelineIO/blob/main/src/opentimelineio/timeline.h), [track](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenTimelineIO/blob/main/src/opentimelineio/track.h), [clip](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenTimelineIO/blob/main/src/opentimelineio/clip.h)). It ships C++ and Python bindings, adapters (OTIO JSON/OTIOZ, FCP XML, AAF and others), and trim/range algorithms.

**Strengths:** neutral time/rational model, nested composition, metadata extensibility and interchange ecosystem; permissive license.

**Limits:** no decoder, compositor, audio mixer or final renderer; metadata conventions still need an application contract. OTIO's object graph is not an undo store.

**Nomi recommendation:** add an `otio` import/export adapter around Nomi's canonical state. Preserve Nomi IDs and unsupported fields in namespaced metadata, warn on lossy conversion, and use OTIO as a compatibility artifact for external NLEs/Agent tools.

### Remotion: high-quality React render path with a commercial license boundary

Remotion is TypeScript/React video composition. The renderer package exposes `renderMedia()` and renders frames in a headless browser before stitching/encoding with FFmpeg ([package manifest](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/main/packages/renderer/package.json), [renderer source](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/main/packages/renderer/src/render-media.ts)). Its current license is custom: individuals, non-profits and for-profit organizations up to three employees may use it free; larger for-profit organizations require a company license, and copying/modifying it to sell/relicense a derivative is disallowed ([license](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/blob/main/LICENSE.md)).

**Strengths:** excellent TS/Electron ergonomics, declarative compositions, browser parity, captions/graphics/templates and a proven render API.

**Limits:** Remotion's `Sequence`/composition tree is not a mutable NLE timeline with ripple edits, source windows, track locking, proposal revisions or native media conforming. Render startup and Chromium memory are material costs.

**Nomi recommendation:** use only as a preview/export adapter for generated compositions or motion graphics if the commercial license is acceptable. Keep the Nomi timeline and convert it into a Remotion composition; never let Remotion state become the project source of truth.

### Olive: architectural reference, not an embeddable core

Olive is a GPL-3.0 C++/Qt application. Its README explicitly labels the current software alpha and highly unstable. The source has a `Sequence` node owning track lists, Qt/OpenGL rendering, a render manager and many undo commands for split/ripple operations ([sequence](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive/blob/master/app/node/project/sequence/sequence.h), [ripple undo](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive/blob/master/app/timeline/timelineundoripple.h), [split undo](https://github.com/olive-editor/olive/blob/master/app/timeline/timelineundosplit.h)).

It demonstrates a capable command/undo architecture, but embedding would mean taking a GPL application with Qt/OpenGL/FFmpeg/OpenColorIO/OpenImageIO dependencies. It is not a safe fast path for Nomi.

### WebAV: WebCodecs compositor and editor primitives

WebAV is MIT and explicitly supports Edge/Chrome and Electron. `@webav/av-cliper` models media as `IClip` (`MP4Clip`, `AudioClip`, `ImgClip`, subtitle clips), attaches temporal/spatial state through sprites, and uses `Combinator` to output MP4. `AVCanvas` provides drag/scale/rotation/time-offset interaction and can capture a `MediaStream` ([README](https://github.com/WebAV-Tech/WebAV/blob/main/README.md), [Combinator](https://github.com/WebAV-Tech/WebAV/blob/main/packages/av-cliper/src/combinator.ts), [AVCanvas](https://github.com/WebAV-Tech/WebAV/blob/main/packages/av-canvas/src/av-canvas.ts)).

**Strengths:** small TS surface, no native build, responsive WebCodecs path, basic multi-sprite audio/video/text compositing and MP4 muxing.

**Limits:** browser codec support, no full NLE command/session model, limited effects/transition ecosystem and no broad native fallback. Long timelines and complex audio require careful memory/backpressure tests.

**Nomi recommendation:** good candidate for a preview/compositor POC and simple local export fallback. Do not replace Nomi's timeline model with sprites.

### Mediabunny: best current TypeScript media-I/O candidate

Mediabunny is a pure TypeScript toolkit under MPL-2.0. Its README claims MP4/MOV/WebM/MKV/HLS/WAVE/MP3 and other formats, WebCodecs hardware acceleration, microsecond precision, streaming I/O, Node/Bun/Deno support and conversion operations such as trim/resample/resize ([README](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny/blob/main/README.md)). The API exports `Input`, `Output`, `Conversion`, track/sample sinks, `CanvasSource`, audio/video sources and multiple mux formats ([index](https://github.com/Vanilagy/mediabunny/blob/main/src/index.ts)).

**Strengths:** low integration cost, tree-shakable, browser/Electron/Node compatibility, explicit timestamp validation, and a permissive weak-copyleft license. OpenCut classic already uses Mediabunny for media and audio work.

**Limits:** it is not a timeline/editor/transition engine; WebCodecs availability and codec support remain platform-dependent; visual effects still belong in Canvas/WebGL/WASM or FFmpeg.

**Nomi recommendation:** evaluate first for probe, thumbnail/filmstrip, audio decode, frame extraction, trim and mux. Keep FFmpeg as the fallback and production reference until an automated format matrix proves parity.

### OpenCut and OpenChatCut: reference architectures, not drop-in cores

OpenCut's current MIT `main` README says it is being rewritten from the ground up and lists Rust core, Editor API, plugins, MCP and headless mode as the target architecture; it points users to the archived classic version for today's usable app ([README](https://github.com/OpenCut-app/OpenCut/blob/main/README.md)). The classic repository is archived and MIT. Its TypeScript timeline has video/text/audio/graphic/effect track types, stable element IDs, trim/source ranges, retime, effects/masks/keyframes, track mute/visibility, and a `TimelineManager` that routes operations through commands, batch history, preview overlay and commit/discard ([types](https://github.com/opencut-app/opencut-classic/blob/main/apps/web/src/timeline/types.ts), [manager](https://github.com/opencut-app/opencut-classic/blob/main/apps/web/src/core/managers/timeline-manager.ts), [update pipeline](https://github.com/opencut-app/opencut-classic/blob/main/apps/web/src/timeline/update-pipeline.ts)).

OpenChatCut is AGPL-3.0 and has the closest product shape to Nomi: immutable timeline state, an `EditorCore` command layer, Remotion/WebGL/FFmpeg, local projects and proposal-based MCP edit sessions. Its README describes `begin_edit_session -> read/edit draft -> review_edit_session -> atomic apply/one undo`, plus specialized timeline/audio/transcript/caption tools ([README](https://github.com/0xsline/OpenChatCut/blob/main/README.md)).

**Nomi recommendation:** copy the capability inventory, update-rule ideas, render-plan boundaries and proposal protocol concepts. Do not copy application code or make OpenCut/OpenChatCut a runtime dependency. OpenChatCut's AGPL network/source obligations and both projects' application-coupled stores make that especially risky.

### FireRed-OpenStoryline: semantic workflow and Skill orchestration reference

FireRed-OpenStoryline is an Apache-2.0 Python 3.11 project with a FastAPI/MCP server. `register_tools.py` scans a node registry and turns each node's Pydantic input schema into an MCP tool wrapper; every invocation carries a session ID, creates a `NodeState`, and records results in an `ArtifactStore`. The repository includes nodes for `search_media`, `load_media`, `split_shots`, `understand_clips`, `filter_clips`, `group_clips`, `generate_script`, `generate_voiceover`, `select_bgm`, `plan_timeline`, `speech_rough_cut`, `generate_ai_transition`, and `render_video`, plus `read_node_history` and Skill persistence.

Its `plan_timeline` output is a render-oriented millisecond manifest with video, subtitles, voiceover and BGM tracks; it is not a durable NLE timeline with clip-ID transactions or user undo. The useful ideas for Nomi are capability discovery, artifact checkpoints, partial redo from an intermediate node, beat-aware music planning, ASR rough-cut semantics, and reusable editing Skills. The Python service, absolute media paths, and artifact store should remain outside Nomi's renderer; adapt its node vocabulary into typed Nomi capabilities and convert accepted results into `EditPlan`/`RenderPlan` through the existing project boundary.

### Palmier Pro: broad MCP inventory and review-oriented UX reference

Palmier Pro is a macOS Swift editor distributed under GPL-3.0. Its MCP catalog is intentionally split by domain rather than exposing one unrestricted `edit_video` command. The checked tools include:

- project/timeline: `get_timeline`, `inspect_timeline`, `create_timeline`, `set_active_timeline`, `manage_markers`, `set_project_settings`, `export_project`;
- media/tracks/clips: `get_media`, `inspect_media`, `search_media`, `import_media`, `manage_tracks`, `add_clips`, `insert_clips`, `move_clips`, `remove_clips`, `split_clips`, `ripple_delete_ranges`, `swap_clip_media`, `set_clip_properties`, `set_keyframes`, `apply_layout`, `sync_clips`;
- review and semantic media: transcript/caption operations, BGM and beat helpers, color/effects/denoise, generation and export-job management;
- transaction ergonomics: timeline version/copy, stable track and clip IDs, an `inspect_timeline` result that includes a composited view with traceable clip IDs, grouped caption summaries with a detail mode, and marker/review workflows.

The inventory is a useful completeness checklist for Nomi: read/inspect, media discovery, track/clip mutations, semantic analysis, review, and export should be separate capabilities with explicit permissions. It is not a reason to import Palmier's Swift store or project model. GPL-3.0, macOS-only APIs, native object lifetimes and its schema would create a platform and licensing dependency that does not protect Nomi's existing Electron/Windows path. Nomi should reproduce the contracts at its own boundary, using stable IDs, `timelineRevision`, `EditPlan`, Adoption and one Undo.

## How the market composes the pieces

Observed product patterns:

- Kdenlive and Shotcut use MLT as a native NLE substrate; the application owns project/UI/undo semantics while MLT supplies service graphs, effects and rendering.
- OpenShot owns a C++ library (`libopenshot`) and a separate Qt application.
- Browser/Electron editors increasingly use WebCodecs + Canvas/WebGL/WASM + a JS muxer (WebAV, Mediabunny, OpenCut's WASM direction).
- Remotion-based products make a React composition the render artifact and keep their own editor state outside Remotion.
- OTIO is used for interchange between systems, not as a live rendering core.
- FFmpeg remains the compatibility and final-export escape hatch even when preview uses a browser/GPU path.
- Agent-first editors put all model actions through validated command/proposal layers; they do not let the model mutate a UI store directly.

The apparent tool-count gap is therefore expected at this stage. Mature products expose dozens of domain tools because they already own transcript indexes, media catalogs, compositors, export jobs and review state. Nomi currently has only the safe control plane; each additional tool must land after its state contract, backend implementation, capability policy and parity test exist.

## Target Nomi tool catalog (staged)

| Stage | Tool family | Initial tools | Preconditions and write boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| P0 (implemented) | Timeline control | `read_timeline`, `inspect_timeline_range`, `propose_edit_plan`, `apply_edit_plan`, `undo_timeline_edit` | Canonical `TimelineState`, stable IDs, CAS revision, project scope, idempotency and one Adoption undo |
| P1 (implemented) | Media and source reads | `get_media`, `inspect_media`, `search_media`, `inspect_source_range`, `read_waveform` | Active-project asset registry, path redaction, bounded technical inspection and real local waveform decoding; semantic vision/ASR remains P3 |
| P1 | Timeline mutations | `move_clip`, `remove_clip`, `split_clip`, `trim_clip`, `set_source_window`, `ripple_delete` | Pure kernel operations expressed inside `EditPlan`; same-track ripple by default; no cross-track drift |
| P2 | Composition | `set_clip_properties`, `apply_layout`, `set_keyframes`, `apply_effect`, `apply_mask`, `set_transition`, `set_audio_mix` | Expanded schema plus FFmpeg/preview parity; unsupported fields return diagnostics, never silent fallback |
| P3 | Semantic editing | `read_transcript`, `find_transcript`, `split_shots`, `speech_rough_cut`, `materialize_captions`, `place_bgm`, `beat_align` | ASR/shot/artifact services return source-bound IDs and timestamps; accepted output becomes an `EditPlan` |
| P4 | Review and output | `preview_edit_plan`, `inspect_render`, `export_timeline`, `verify_render`, `manage_markers` | Shared versioned `RenderPlan`, cancellable jobs, frame/audio checks, artifact retention and audit receipts |

Low-level mutation tools in the table are adapters over the same EditPlan transaction; they are not direct store methods. The public catalog can grow to match Palmier/OpenChatCut only after each row has a concrete implementation and a testable refusal path.

## Recommended Nomi target architecture

```text
TimelineState (唯一事实源)
  -> pure EditOperations + validator + revision/idempotency
  -> EditPlan / one transaction / one undo
  -> RenderPlan (stable, explicit source windows, effects, audio, captions)
       |-> WebAV/WebGL/WASM preview adapter (optional)
       |-> Mediabunny WebCodecs media I/O adapter (optional fast path)
       |-> FFmpeg worker (production/reference export)
       |-> MLT/libopenshot worker (experimental native backend)
  -> OTIO import/export adapter
  -> Agent/MCP: read -> inspect -> propose -> review -> apply -> verify
```

Hard boundaries:

- React/Zustand and Agent code never hold native MLT/GES/libopenshot objects.
- A backend receives a versioned `RenderPlan`, not the mutable store.
- Preview and export consume the same semantic plan; backend-specific diagnostics are returned to the UI.
- Backend selection is per job and capability-tested, not a hidden fallback that can change output silently.
- The Pi Agent runtime, MCPSQ migration and Electron bridge remain untouched while the renderer evaluation is isolated.

## Phased execution and gates

### P0: contract and parity fixture

- Freeze Nomi timeline fields: stable IDs, half-open frame/time ranges, source window, retime, framing, transitions, audio gain/mute, captions and revision.
- Define `RenderPlan v1` and diagnostics/error codes.
- Build fixtures with cuts, overlays, audio, captions, trim, speed, fades and one transition.
- Acceptance: deterministic plan hash; no backend mutates `TimelineState`.

### P1: reuse low-risk TypeScript media primitives

- Add a MediaBunny adapter for probe, thumbnails, audio decode and simple trim/mux.
- Keep FFmpeg probe/export as the reference and fallback.
- Acceptance: format matrix on Windows/macOS/Linux/Electron; frame-accurate trim; audio/video duration and color checks.

### P2: preview/export parity

- POC WebAV or OpenCut WASM compositor for one clip + overlay + opacity/effect + audio.
- Compare sampled preview frames and exported frames against FFmpeg reference with tolerances.
- Acceptance: no blank frames, bounded memory, cancellation, resource cleanup, and identical timeline semantics.

### P3: native backend spike (only if needed)

- Implement the same `RenderPlan v1` through MLT and libopenshot workers.
- Measure startup, export speed, memory, hardware acceleration, transitions/effects/audio coverage, crash isolation and package size.
- Select a backend only if it beats the TS/FFmpeg combination on a defined workload and has acceptable licensing/compliance.

### P4: capability expansion

- Move/remove/reorder/ripple/split/trim/source window and retime first.
- Then multi-track audio/mixing/ducking, transform/effects/masks/keyframes/transitions, transcript/word timing and caption materialization.
- Every operation is a pure edit operation and can be represented in an `EditPlan`.

### P5: Agent/MCP integration

- Stable controls: `read_timeline`, `inspect_timeline_range`, `propose_edit_plan`, `apply_edit_plan`.
- Semantic reads: transcript, media search, source-range inspection.
- Output/verification: preview plan, export plan, verify render.
- Enforce base revision, stable IDs, idempotency keys, validate-only mode and one Undo per applied plan.

## Decision gates and risks

| Gate | Pass condition | Stop/rollback condition |
|---|---|---|
| License | SPDX inventory and binary notices are acceptable | GPL/AGPL/custom commercial terms cannot be accepted |
| API fit | Adapter can express all P0 operations without hidden state | Backend requires UI/store ownership or lossy fields |
| Parity | Preview/export match the same `RenderPlan` on fixture matrix | Backend output differs or silently drops audio/effects |
| Performance | Measured improvement on representative long/multi-track jobs | Startup/memory/package cost outweighs gain |
| Reliability | Cancellation, crash isolation, retries and temp cleanup are deterministic | Native crash can corrupt project or block renderer |
| Maintenance | Active upstream, pinned version and upgrade test | Archived/unmaintained code becomes a core dependency |

Main risks are native binary distribution, FFmpeg codec licensing, browser WebCodecs variance, audio retime/mixing quality, GPU driver differences and accidental second timeline state. These are why backend experiments must stay behind the versioned plan and process boundary.
